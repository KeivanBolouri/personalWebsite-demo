Abstract**

::: text-justify
Electroconductive polymers (ECPs) have garnered increasing attention in the realms of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to their unique physicochemical properties, including their ability to conduct electrical signals. These polymers, with inherent conductivity mirroring that of native tissues, present a promising platform for scaffolds that can modulate cell behavior and tissue formation through electrical stimulation. The biocompatibility, tunable conductivity, and topographical features of ECPs enhance cellular adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Furthermore, their electrical properties have been shown to augment nerve regeneration, cardiac tissue repair, and musculoskeletal tissue formation. Combined with other biomaterials or biological molecules, ECP-based composites exhibit synergistic effects, promoting enhanced tissue regeneration. Moreover, the integration of ECPs with cutting-edge technologies such as 3D printing and microfluidics propels the design of sophisticated constructs for tissue engineering applications. This paper concludes with the challenges faced in the clinical translation of ECP-based scaffolds and provides perspectives on the future trajectory of ECPs in regenerative medicine. The synthesis of ECPs with emerging biotechnologies has the potential to revolutionize treatments, bridging the gap between traditional regenerative approaches and sophisticated bioelectronic remedies.
