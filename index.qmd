Welcome to my page!\

## About me

Hello! My name is **Keivan Bolouri**. I am passionate about technology, data, and continuous learning.\
I enjoy building projects, exploring new tools, and applying what I learn to real-world problems.

## Education

-   **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)**

    ::: text-justify
    I’m currently pursuing a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science at UCLA, where I focus on turning complex data into clear, actionable insights. Alongside core training in statistical modeling and algorithmic thinking, I’m especially interested in **statistical genetics** and **computational biology**—fields that let me explore how data can reveal the patterns and mechanisms behind biological systems.

Outside of academics, I enjoy **hiking**, **running**, and staying active outdoors.\
