Nanotechnology has further aided tissue regeneration science and has provided outstanding opportunities to help disease diagnosis as well as treat damaged tissues. Based on the most recent findings, magnetic nanostructures (MNSs), in particular, have emerged as promising materials for detecting, directing, and supporting tissue regeneration. There have been many reports concerning the role of these nano-building blocks in the regeneration of both soft and hard tissues, but the subject has not been extensively reviewed. Here, we review, classify, and discuss various synthesis strategies for novel MNSs used in medicine. Advanced applications of magnetic nanocomposites (MG-NCs), specifically magnetic nanostructures, are further systematically reviewed. In addition, the scientific and technical aspects of MG-NC used in medicine are discussed considering the requirements for the field. In summary, this review highlights the numerous opportunities and challenges associated with the use of MG-NCs as smart nanocomposites (NCs) in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n View Published Article"

Researchers are taking advantage of naturally derived cell membranes to enhance the bio-interfacing capabilities of nanoparticles. The use of cell membrane-coating technology represents an exciting breakthrough in the field of nanomedicine. This technique has the potential to enhance the ability of nanoparticles to interact with biological systems and deliver drugs or therapeutic agents more effectively in clinical settings. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the different types of cells used for membrane coating of nanoparticles, including red blood cells, platelets, white blood cells, stem cells, cancer cells, hybrid cells, and other specialized cell types like beta cells, endothelial cells, fibroblast cells, and bacterial cells. The chapter delves into the origin and function of each of these cell types and highlights the potential applications of cell membrane-coating technology for each.\n\n View Book Chapter"

    "text": "Abstract\n\nThis review examines the synthesis, properties, and broad-spectrum applications of electroconductive polymers (ECPs), including polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene, polyphenylene, and polyacetylene. These polymers exhibit high electrical conductivity, versatility in fabrication, and compatibility with various functionalization techniques, making them particularly attractive for diverse applications. While ECPs have traditionally been used in sensors, actuators, and energy storage systems, their utility extends much further, most notably to the realm of biomedical applications. The review meticulously explores the synthesis techniques of ECPs, shedding light on both chemical and electrochemical methods, and the pivotal role that dopants and polymerization techniques play in shaping the properties of the resultant polymers. Apart from discussing the conventional applications of ECPs, the review devotes substantial attention to their groundbreaking biomedical applications, like tissue engineering, medical implants, and the creation of interfaces with biological tissues. It also underscores the future trajectory of ECP research, emphasizing the development of innovative materials and fabrication methodologies for more advanced applications. With this holistic analysis of the field, the review seeks to enhance readers’’ understanding of the intrinsic properties, structural complexities, and fabrication nuances of ECPs, and inspire continued research and development in this fascinating and consequential domain of materials science.\n\n View Published Article"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nElectroconductive polymers (ECPs) have garnered increasing attention in the realms of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to their unique physicochemical properties, including their ability to conduct electrical signals. These polymers, with inherent conductivity mirroring that of native tissues, present a promising platform for scaffolds that can modulate cell behavior and tissue formation through electrical stimulation. The biocompatibility, tunable conductivity, and topographical features of ECPs enhance cellular adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Furthermore, their electrical properties have been shown to augment nerve regeneration, cardiac tissue repair, and musculoskeletal tissue formation. Combined with other biomaterials or biological molecules, ECP-based composites exhibit synergistic effects, promoting enhanced tissue regeneration. Moreover, the integration of ECPs with cutting-edge technologies such as 3D printing and microfluidics propels the design of sophisticated constructs for tissue engineering applications. This paper concludes with the challenges faced in the clinical translation of ECP-based scaffolds and provides perspectives on the future trajectory of ECPs in regenerative medicine. The synthesis of ECPs with emerging biotechnologies has the potential to revolutionize treatments, bridging the gap between traditional regenerative approaches and sophisticated bioelectronic remedies.\n\n View Published Article"

    "text": "Abstract\n\nThe occurrence of traumatic bone defects caused by accidents, diseases, and surgeries has become increasingly common. Consequently, there has been a noticeable increase in the overall number of bone defects reported. Treating bone defects is characterized by long treatment periods, high costs, and unpredictable outcomes, often accompanied by complications like infections and bone discontinuity. Consequently, this situation significantly impacts the physical, mental, and financial well-being of patients and poses a challenge to orthopedic surgeons. This has piqued a considerable interest in the realm of bone therapy and repair. Materials other than autogenous bone have not yet achieved the ability to offer ideal biocompatibility, osteogenesis, osteoconductivity, and osteoinduction properties simultaneously. Moreover, the scarcity of autologous bone sources has necessitated the search for new replacement materials. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a novel class of functional materials that have gained extensive attention in the biomedical field in recent years. This is attributed to their porous nature, large specific surface area, tailorable chemistry, and their potential for drug loading. As bone treatment and repair research progresses, more investigators are exploring the potential of using MOFs for bone therapy and repair applications. Taking all these aspects into account, this chapter summarizes the current utilization of MOFs in bone therapy and regeneration, while also providing an outlook on the potential prospects of MOFs in this field.\n\n\n View Book Chapter"

    "section": "Exploratory Data Analysis",
    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis\nWe began by examining the overall structure and distributions in the training dataset. The response variable (Cancer) is binary (Benign or Malignant), and we observed a slight class imbalance: benign lesions were more frequent than malignant lesions in the training data. This imbalance means that a naive classifier that predicts all cases as benign would achieve a non-trivial accuracy, so careful model evaluation is necessary. We also inspected the distribution of key predictors. For example, the average age of patients with malignant lesions appeared higher than that of patients with benign lesions, consistent with the fact that skin cancer risk increases with age. We explored categorical risk factors as well: certain exposure-related factors (such as indicators of high UV exposure or tanning habits) were somewhat more prevalent in malignant cases, though there was significant overlap between the benign and malignant groups for most individual predictors. Overall, no single predictor showed a dramatic separation between malignant and benign lesions in isolation, suggesting that multiple factors in combination would be needed for effective prediction. In addition, we checked for missing data and outliers during the exploratory phase. We found that the dataset’s overall quality was high, with only a moderate amount of missing values (on the order of 7–8% missing per predictor). There was no evidence of extreme outliers that would require removal or transformation beyond standardization. The presence of some missing values and the lack of obvious one-variable predictors of cancer underlined the need for a robust modeling approach with proper data preprocessing, which we implemented as described below."

    "text": "Data Cleaning and Missing Values\nAfter completing the exploratory analysis, we examined the dataset for missing values. We found that the overall data quality was relatively high, with most predictors containing approximately 7–8% missing values. No predictor exceeded 10% missingness, so eliminating variables or observations would have resulted in unnecessary data loss. To address missing values in a consistent manner, we applied the following imputation strategy: Numerical variables were imputed using the median, which is robust to outliers. Categorical variables were imputed using the most frequent category (mode). This approach allowed us to preserve all 50,000 observations in the training dataset while ensuring that the data were suitable for modeling. After imputation, no missing values remained in the predictors used for analysis.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Top ten variables with the highest proportion of missing values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nMissing (%)\n\n\n\n\nvitamin_d_supplement\n8.3\n\n\nphone_brand\n8.2\n\n\nskin_tone\n8.2\n\n\nsunscreen_spf\n8.2\n\n\npreferred_shoe_type\n8.2\n\n\nsunscreen_freq\n8.2\n\n\nresidence_lat\n8.2\n\n\ncommute_minutes\n8.1\n\n\nnear_high_power_cables\n8.1\n\n\nincome\n8.1\n\n\n\n (a) Training set variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nMissing (%)\n\n\n\n\nresidence_lon\n8.5\n\n\nphone_brand\n8.4\n\n\npreferred_shoe_type\n8.3\n\n\nuses_smartwatch\n8.3\n\n\nskin_tone\n8.3\n\n\nsmoking_status\n8.2\n\n\nincome\n8.2\n\n\nnear_high_power_cables\n8.2\n\n\nlesion_color\n8.2\n\n\nskin_photosensitivity\n8.1\n\n\n\n (b) Test set variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing these association measures, all predictors were ranked from strongest to weakest. Variables with very weak association to the response variable were discarded, while stronger predictors were retained. This process reduced the dataset from 51 variables to 35 total variables, including the response variable. The final set consisted of 20 numerical predictors and 14 categorical predictors, while maintaining all original observations. This variable selection process helped simplify the modeling stage, reduced multicollinearity, and improved model interpretability, while retaining the most informative predictors for classification."

    "text": "Variable Selection\nGiven the large number of predictors, variable selection was necessary to reduce dimensionality and eliminate weak predictors that could introduce noise and increase the risk of overfitting. For categorical predictors, we used Cramér’s V to measure the strength of association between each categorical variable and the cancer outcome. Cramér’s V is based on the chi-squared statistic and produces values between 0 and 1, with larger values indicating stronger association. Here is a sample of the first 10 variables: For numerical predictors, we computed the point-biserial correlation, which measures the strength of association between a continuous predictor and a binary response variable. Numerical variables were ranked based on the absolute value of this correlation.\n\n\n\nTop 10 Categorical Predictors Ranked by Cramér’s V (Training Data)\n\n\nVariable\nCramér’s V\n\n\n\n\nfamily_history\n0.104\n\n\nskin_tone\n0.087\n\n\nsunscreen_freq\n0.066\n\n\nimmunosuppressed\n0.060\n\n\noccupation\n0.045\n\n\ntanning_bed_use\n0.041\n\n\nclothing_protection\n0.036\n\n\nskin_photosensitivity\n0.033\n\n\nhat_use\n0.028\n\n\nlesion_location\n0.011\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 Numerical Predictors Ranked by Point-Biserial Correlation (Training Data)\n\n\nVariable\nPoint-Biserial Correlation\n\n\n\n\nage\n0.1355\n\n\navg_daily_uv\n0.0599\n\n\nnumber_of_lesions\n0.0513\n\n\nsunburns_last_year\n0.0457\n\n\noutdoor_job\n0.0451\n\n\nlesion_size_mm\n0.0223\n\n\nsunscreen_spf\n-0.0174\n\n\nyears_lived_at_address\n0.0103\n\n\nincome\n0.0088\n\n\ndesk_height_cm\n0.0083\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 35\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Selected Predictors After Association-Based Variable Screening\n\n\nNo\nType\nVariable\nSelection Criterion\n\n\n\n\n1\nCategorical\nfamily_history\nCramér’s V &gt; 0.05\n\n\n2\nCategorical\nskin_tone\nCramér’s V &gt; 0.05\n\n\n3\nCategorical\nsunscreen_freq\nCramér’s V &gt; 0.05\n\n\n4\nCategorical\nimmunosuppressed\nCramér’s V &gt; 0.05\n\n\n5\nCategorical\noccupation\nCramér’s V &gt; 0.05\n\n\n6\nCategorical\ntanning_bed_use\nCramér’s V &gt; 0.05\n\n\n7\nCategorical\nclothing_protection\nCramér’s V &gt; 0.05\n\n\n8\nCategorical\nskin_photosensitivity\nCramér’s V &gt; 0.05\n\n\n9\nCategorical\nhat_use\nCramér’s V &gt; 0.05\n\n\n10\nCategorical\nlesion_location\nCramér’s V &gt; 0.05\n\n\n11\nCategorical\nfavorite_cuisine\nCramér’s V &gt; 0.05\n\n\n12\nCategorical\nmusic_genre\nCramér’s V &gt; 0.05\n\n\n13\nCategorical\nlesion_color\nCramér’s V &gt; 0.05\n\n\n14\nCategorical\nsunscreen_brand\nCramér’s V &gt; 0.05\n\n\n1\nNumerical\nage\nAbs.
