    "text": "Abstract\n\nElectroconductive polymers (ECPs) have garnered increasing attention in the realms of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to their unique physicochemical properties, including their ability to conduct electrical signals. These polymers, with inherent conductivity mirroring that of native tissues, present a promising platform for scaffolds that can modulate cell behavior and tissue formation through electrical stimulation. The biocompatibility, tunable conductivity, and topographical features of ECPs enhance cellular adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Furthermore, their electrical properties have been shown to augment nerve regeneration, cardiac tissue repair, and musculoskeletal tissue formation. Combined with other biomaterials or biological molecules, ECP-based composites exhibit synergistic effects, promoting enhanced tissue regeneration. Moreover, the integration of ECPs with cutting-edge technologies such as 3D printing and microfluidics propels the design of sophisticated constructs for tissue engineering applications. This paper concludes with the challenges faced in the clinical translation of ECP-based scaffolds and provides perspectives on the future trajectory of ECPs in regenerative medicine. The synthesis of ECPs with emerging biotechnologies has the potential to revolutionize treatments, bridging the gap between traditional regenerative approaches and sophisticated bioelectronic remedies."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nThe occurrence of traumatic bone defects caused by accidents, diseases, and surgeries has become increasingly common. Consequently, there has been a noticeable increase in the overall number of bone defects reported. Treating bone defects is characterized by long treatment periods, high costs, and unpredictable outcomes, often accompanied by complications like infections and bone discontinuity. Consequently, this situation significantly impacts the physical, mental, and financial well-being of patients and poses a challenge to orthopedic surgeons. This has piqued a considerable interest in the realm of bone therapy and repair. Materials other than autogenous bone have not yet achieved the ability to offer ideal biocompatibility, osteogenesis, osteoconductivity, and osteoinduction properties simultaneously. Moreover, the scarcity of autologous bone sources has necessitated the search for new replacement materials. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a novel class of functional materials that have gained extensive attention in the biomedical field in recent years. This is attributed to their porous nature, large specific surface area, tailorable chemistry, and their potential for drug loading. As bone treatment and repair research progresses, more investigators are exploring the potential of using MOFs for bone therapy and repair applications. Taking all these aspects into account, this chapter summarizes the current utilization of MOFs in bone therapy and regeneration, while also providing an outlook on the potential prospects of MOFs in this field."
