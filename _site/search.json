    "text": "Abstract\n\nThe occurrence of traumatic bone defects caused by accidents, diseases, and surgeries has become increasingly common. Consequently, there has been a noticeable increase in the overall number of bone defects reported. Treating bone defects is characterized by long treatment periods, high costs, and unpredictable outcomes, often accompanied by complications like infections and bone discontinuity. Consequently, this situation significantly impacts the physical, mental, and financial well-being of patients and poses a challenge to orthopedic surgeons. This has piqued a considerable interest in the realm of bone therapy and repair. Materials other than autogenous bone have not yet achieved the ability to offer ideal biocompatibility, osteogenesis, osteoconductivity, and osteoinduction properties simultaneously. Moreover, the scarcity of autologous bone sources has necessitated the search for new replacement materials. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a novel class of functional materials that have gained extensive attention in the biomedical field in recent years. This is attributed to their porous nature, large specific surface area, tailorable chemistry, and their potential for drug loading. As bone treatment and repair research progresses, more investigators are exploring the potential of using MOFs for bone therapy and repair applications. Taking all these aspects into account, this chapter summarizes the current utilization of MOFs in bone therapy and regeneration, while also providing an outlook on the potential prospects of MOFs in this field.\n\n\n View Book Chapter"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nElectroconductive polymers (ECPs) have garnered increasing attention in the realms of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to their unique physicochemical properties, including their ability to conduct electrical signals. These polymers, with inherent conductivity mirroring that of native tissues, present a promising platform for scaffolds that can modulate cell behavior and tissue formation through electrical stimulation. The biocompatibility, tunable conductivity, and topographical features of ECPs enhance cellular adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Furthermore, their electrical properties have been shown to augment nerve regeneration, cardiac tissue repair, and musculoskeletal tissue formation. Combined with other biomaterials or biological molecules, ECP-based composites exhibit synergistic effects, promoting enhanced tissue regeneration. Moreover, the integration of ECPs with cutting-edge technologies such as 3D printing and microfluidics propels the design of sophisticated constructs for tissue engineering applications. This paper concludes with the challenges faced in the clinical translation of ECP-based scaffolds and provides perspectives on the future trajectory of ECPs in regenerative medicine. The synthesis of ECPs with emerging biotechnologies has the potential to revolutionize treatments, bridging the gap between traditional regenerative approaches and sophisticated bioelectronic remedies.\n\n View Published Article"

    "text": "Abstract\n\nThis review examines the synthesis, properties, and broad-spectrum applications of electroconductive polymers (ECPs), including polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene, polyphenylene, and polyacetylene. These polymers exhibit high electrical conductivity, versatility in fabrication, and compatibility with various functionalization techniques, making them particularly attractive for diverse applications. While ECPs have traditionally been used in sensors, actuators, and energy storage systems, their utility extends much further, most notably to the realm of biomedical applications. The review meticulously explores the synthesis techniques of ECPs, shedding light on both chemical and electrochemical methods, and the pivotal role that dopants and polymerization techniques play in shaping the properties of the resultant polymers. Apart from discussing the conventional applications of ECPs, the review devotes substantial attention to their groundbreaking biomedical applications, like tissue engineering, medical implants, and the creation of interfaces with biological tissues. It also underscores the future trajectory of ECP research, emphasizing the development of innovative materials and fabrication methodologies for more advanced applications. With this holistic analysis of the field, the review seeks to enhance readers’’ understanding of the intrinsic properties, structural complexities, and fabrication nuances of ECPs, and inspire continued research and development in this fascinating and consequential domain of materials science.\n\n View Published Article"

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\nCells are essential components of biological systems and are involved in various activities, such as interacting with the surrounding environment. Researchers are taking advantage of naturally derived cell membranes to enhance the bio-interfacing capabilities of nanoparticles. The use of cell membrane-coating technology represents an exciting breakthrough in the field of nanomedicine. This technique has the potential to enhance the ability of nanoparticles to interact with biological systems and deliver drugs or therapeutic agents more effectively in clinical settings. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the different types of cells used for membrane coating of nanoparticles, including red blood cells, platelets, white blood cells, stem cells, cancer cells, hybrid cells, and other specialized cell types like beta cells, endothelial cells, fibroblast cells, and bacterial cells. The chapter delves into the origin and function of each of these cell types and highlights the potential applications of cell membrane-coating technology for each.\n\n View Book Chapter"

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\n\nTissue engineering and regenerative medicine have solved numerous problems related to the repair and regeneration of damaged organs and tissues arising from aging, illnesses, and injuries. Nanotechnology has further aided tissue regeneration science and has provided outstanding opportunities to help disease diagnosis as well as treat damaged tissues. Based on the most recent findings, magnetic nanostructures (MNSs), in particular, have emerged as promising materials for detecting, directing, and supporting tissue regeneration. There have been many reports concerning the role of these nano-building blocks in the regeneration of both soft and hard tissues, but the subject has not been extensively reviewed. Here, we review, classify, and discuss various synthesis strategies for novel MNSs used in medicine. Advanced applications of magnetic nanocomposites (MG-NCs), specifically magnetic nanostructures, are further systematically reviewed. In addition, the scientific and technical aspects of MG-NC used in medicine are discussed considering the requirements for the field. In summary, this review highlights the numerous opportunities and challenges associated with the use of MG-NCs as smart nanocomposites (NCs) in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n View Published Article"
